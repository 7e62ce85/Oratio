## Local development

The [setup](README.md#setup) section of the README explains how to get a local instance running

## Submitting changes

 1. Make sure to run `pre-commit install` before committing your changes. This will re-format your code
 using `black` to make sure it's PEP8 compliant, among other checks.
 2. All code submitted must be PEP8 compliant.
 3. All tests, new and existing must pass. If submitting new features, it is highly recommended to add
 plenty of tests to make sure it does not break in the future.
