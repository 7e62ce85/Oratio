## ✅ YES - Your System is Now Self-Checking and Self-Healing!

### What Runs Automatically (No Manual Intervention Needed)

#### 1. **Hourly Health Checks** ⏰
- **When:** Every hour (at :00 minutes)
- **What it does:**
  - Checks ElectronCash connection
  - Monitors memory usage (alerts if >500 MB)
  - Counts processes (alerts if >10)
  - Automatically restarts if problems detected
- **Log:** `/home/user/Oratio/oratio/logs/cron.log`

#### 2. **Daily Preventive Restart** 🔄
- **When:** Every day at 3:00 AM
- **What it does:**
  - Restarts electron-cash container

## What You Can Do Manually (Optional)

### Quick Status Check
```bash
/home/user/Oratio/oratio/status.sh
```
Shows you everything at a glance!

### View Real-Time Logs
```bash
# Health check activity
tail -f /home/user/Oratio/oratio/logs/cron.log

# Container logs
docker logs -f electron-cash
```

### Manual Health Check (Force Check Now)
```bash
/home/user/Oratio/oratio/health_check_and_restart.sh
```

## Monitoring Schedule

| Time | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Every Hour** | Health check | Detect and fix problems |
| **Daily 3 AM** | Preventive restart | Clear any accumulations |
| **Weekly Sunday 4 AM** | Log cleanup | Manage disk space |
| **On Reboot** | Auto-start containers | Resume service |
| **Always** | Memory limit enforcement | Prevent leaks |

## What to Expect

### Normal Operation (Most of the time)
- ✅ System runs silently
- ✅ Health checks pass every hour
- ✅ Memory stays under 200 MB
- ✅ 2-3 Python processes
- ✅ No manual intervention needed

### If Problem Occurs
1. **Automated detection** (within 1 hour)
2. **Automatic restart** (if needed)
3. **Logged to file** (for your review)
4. **Email notification** (if configured)

### When You Should Check Manually
- ⚠️ If you notice slow response times
- ⚠️ After major updates
- ⚠️ If you're curious about system health
- ✅ Or just run `status.sh` anytime!

## Summary: Do You Need to Check Daily?

### ❌ **NO** - Daily Manual Checks NOT Required

The system is **fully automated** with:
- Hourly monitoring
- Auto-healing
- Memory protection
- Automatic restarts

### ✅ **Optional Weekly Glance** (Recommended)

Once a week, just run:
```bash
/home/user/Oratio/oratio/status.sh
```

This gives you peace of mind but is **not required** for system operation.
